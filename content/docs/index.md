# The lightest static-site generator

Hydrogen uses JavaScript as it's templating engine, it's aimed at doing one thing really well which is converting <i>template literals</i> to HTML making it super extensible as you have the whole <span style="color: #007acc;">Node.js</span> ecosystem at your fingertips.

Before ES6, JavaScript was not considered powerful enough to manipulate large chunks of the DOM and template engines like Handlebars and Pug filled that void. Now that JavaScript is more powerful than ever, it's time for JS to shine as a viable templating engine.

* **âš¡ Millisecond Builds.** With the global average attention span being 8 seconds, why wait seconds for your builds when you can wait milliseconds.
