# The lightest static-site generator

Hydrogen uses JavaScript as it's templating engine, it's aimed at doing one thing really well which is converting _template literals_ to HTML making it super extensible as you have the whole Node.js ecosystem at your fingertips.

Before ES6, JavaScript was not considered powerful enough to manipulate large chunks of the DOM and template engines like Handlebars and Pug filled that void. Now that JavaScript is more powerful than ever, it's time for JS to shine as a viable templating engine.

Hydrogen provides you with:

-   **⚡ Millisecond Builds.** With the global average attention span being 8 seconds, why wait seconds for your builds when you can wait milliseconds.
-   **🔥 JavaScript Templates.** With ES6 template literals, who needs template engines like pug and handlebars. You now have access to the full-power of JavaScript.
-   **🔌 Use External APIs.** Plug into your data with remote APIs.
-   **🕶 Powerful Metadata API.** Get the best SEO for your static pages.
-   **🔨 Build Hooks.** Customize the build process to fit your needs
-   **💾 Service Worker friendly.** Build powerful offline-first experiences

# Getting Started | 🎈 Hydrogen

> ## Excerpt
> Learn how to get up and running with Hydrogen

---
# 🔨 Getting Started

___

Hydrogen is available on [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/hydrogen-cli) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hydrogen-cli) and requires Node.js 8 and higher. We will be using Yarn as the package manager throughout the documentation

## Step 1: Setup a project

We need a folder to store our project files

```
    
      $ mkdir hydrogen-sample
      $ cd hydrogen-sample
    
  
```

## Step 2: Install Hydrogen

Our project needs a `_package.json_`. We can use Yarn to make one

```
    
      $ yarn init -y
    
  
```

Add Hydrogen to the `package.json`

```
    
      $ yarn add hydrogen-cli
    
  
```

## Step 3: Create a template

Let's create a simple template which we will store in `index.js` file

```
    
      const page = ({ title, head, data }) => `
        <html>
          <head>
            ${head}
            <title>${title}</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            <p>${data.text}</p>
          </body>
        </html>
      `;

      module.exports = {
        title: 'Hydrogen webpage',
        page,
        data: () => ({
          text: 'Hello from Hydrogen',
          css: 'https://main.css',
        }),
        head: ({ data }) => [
          ['link', { rel: 'stylesheet', href: data.css }],
          ['script', { src: 'https://script.js' }, true],
          ['style', {}, 'body { font-size: 10px; }'],
        ],
      };
    
  
```

## Step 4: Build the template

We need to run the `generate` command to build the `index.js` template. The output of template will be stored in a file of the same name as the template but with the `.html` extension.

```
    
      $ npx hydrogen generate index.js
    
  
```

`index.html`

```
    
      <html>
        <head>
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://main.css" />
          <script src="https://script.js"></script>
          <style>body { font-size: 10px; }</style>
          <title>Hydrogen webpage</title>
        </head>
        <body>
          <p>Hello from Hydrogen</p>
        </body>
      </html>
    
  
```

The _generate_ command is more of a lower-level template generator, for a more advanced setup we use the _build_ command for working with more larger projects. Find out more in the [Advanced Setup](https://hydrogen-js.netlify.app/docs/advanced-setup) section.

# ⚙ Advanced Setup

___

If you have not read the [Getting Started](https://hydrogen-js.netlify.app/docs/getting-started) guide, now would be the perfect time! The Advanced Section builds on top of what we did in the Getting Started section.

## Step 1: Setting up a layout

A `layout` is a template that contains our application shell which our `page` templates get injected into. Create a folder called "layouts", this is where our layouts will be stored.

layouts/default.js

```
    
      module.exports = ({ title, content }) => `
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
          <head>
            <title>${title}</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            ${content}
          </body>
        </html>
      `;
    
  
```

`title` is provided by the page template and `content` is the result of the generated page template. Now that we have our layout, we now need to use link it to a page template.

## Step 2: Setting up a page

A `page` is a template that contains your page content. All page templates are stored in the pages folder.

pages/index.js

```
    
      const page = ({ data }) => `
        <p>${data.text}</p>
      `;

      module.exports = {
        layout: 'default',
        title: 'Hydrogen webpage',
        page,
        data: () => ({
          text: 'Hello from Hydrogen 🎈',
        }),
      };
    
  
```

## Step 3: Building our templates into HTML

After setting up our pages and layouts, we are now able to generate our templates into deployable HTML files. The built files are stored in `dist`. To build your templates run the `build` command

```
    
      $ npx hydrogen build
       _   _           _
      | | | |_   _  __| |_ __ ___   __ _  ___ _ __  
      | |_| | | | |/ _` | '__/ _ \ / _` |/ _ \ '_ \ 
      |  _  | |_| | (_| | | | (_) | (_| |  __/ | | |
      |_| |_|\__, |\__,_|_|  \___/ \__, |\___|_| |_|
              |___/                 |___/

      MODE: PRODUCTION
      Building files... done
      Build time: 49.934ms
    
  
```

Use the `--dev` to enable builds in development mode

## Step 4: Using static assets like CSS and JS

If you have static assets like CSS, JS, Images and etc... You can create a folder called `public` in the root of the project. You can place any assets you like in this folder and when you run the `build` command the public folder is automatically hoisted into the dist folder.

Repeat Step 3 to see how it works.

## Step 5: Setting up a dev server

Most static-site generators provide a development server out of the box but not Hydrogen. Hydrogen gives all the power to you, so you can setup our own development server. Here is a simple development server setup with hot reloading.

We need some way to re-run hydrogen when files change and push the updates to the browser. We can use `nodemon` `live-server` `npm-run-all` packages

Install packages

```
    
        $ yarn add -D nodemon live-server npm-run-all
    
  
```

Update package.json

```
    
        {
          "scripts": {
            "reload": "npx cross-env npx nodemon -w ./layouts -w ./pages -w ./public --exec \"npx hydrogen build --dev\"",
            "serve": "npx cross-env npx live-server ./dist",
            "dev": "npx npm-run-all --parallel reload serve"
          }
        }
    
  
```

Run `yarn dev` then you will have neat little development server with hot reloading

---
# 🌐 Working with Data

___

Hydrogen has a powerful API for exposing data to your page templates using the data method, we can expose synchronous or asynchronous data.

Let's see how we can do this!

## Using Synchronous Data

Synchronous data is any data that does not require some sort of API call to an endpoint.

Using a simple object

```
    
      const page = ({ title, data }) => `
        <html>
          <head>
            <title>${title}</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            <p>${data.text}</p>
          </body>
        </html>
      `;

      module.exports = {
        title: 'Hydrogen webpage',
        page,
        data: ({ dev }) => ({
          text: 'Hello from Hydrogen',
        }),
      };
    
  
```

Using JSON data

```
    
      const data = require('./data.json');

      const page = ({ title, data }) => `
        <html>
          <head>
            <title>${title}</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            <ul>
              ${data.posts.map((post) => `<li>${post.title}</li>`).join('')}
            </ul>
          </body>
        </html>
      `;

      module.exports = {
        title: 'Hydrogen webpage',
        page,
        data: ({ dev }) => ({
          posts: data,
        }),
      };
    
  
```

## Using Asynchronous Data

Asynchronous data is any data that is sitting in a remote API

Hitting a remote API

```
    
      const axios = require('axios');

      const page = ({ title, data }) => `
        <html>
          <head>
            <title>${title}</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            <p>${data.githubStars}</p>
          </body>
        </html>
      `;

      module.exports = {
        title: 'Hydrogen webpage',
        page,
        data: async ({ dev }) => ({
          githubStars: await axios.get('https://githubstars.com').then((res) => res.data),
        }),
      };
    
 
```



# Working with Metadata | 🎈 Hydrogen

> ## Excerpt
> Want to add some metadata to your page? Now you can with the Head API! All page templates have access to this API

---
# 🕶 Working with Metadata`+v0.5`

Want to add some metadata to your page? Now you can with the `Head API`! All page templates have access to this API

## Using the Head API

Using static metadata

You can access the head property in the layout template

```
    
      module.exports = ({ title, content, head, dev }) => `
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
          <head>
            ${head}
            <script src="${dev ? 'https://dev.script.js' : 'https://prod.script.js'}"></script>
            <title>${title}</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            ${content}
          </body>
        </html>
      `;
    
  
```

In your page template you can export the head function

```
    
      const page = ({ data, dev }) => `
        <p>${data.text}</p>
      `;

      module.exports = {
        layout: 'default',
        title: 'Hydrogen webpage',
        page,
        data: () => ({
          text: 'Hydrogen metadata',
        }),
        head: () => [
          ['meta', { name: 'description', content: 'Hydrogen metadata' }],
        ];
      };
    
  
```

Run build command

```
    
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
        <head>
          <meta name="description" content="Hydrogen metadata" />
          <script src="https://dev.script.js"></script>
          <title>Hydrogen webpage</title>
        </head>
        <body>
          <p>Hydrogen metadata</p>
        </body>
      </html>
    
  
```

## Using asynchronous data with the Head API

We also have access to the data from the Data API

```
    
      const axios = require('axios');

      const page = ({ data, dev }) => `
        <p>This project has ${data.likes} likes</p>
      `;

      module.exports = {
        layout: 'default',
        title: 'Hydrogen webpage',
        page,
        data: async ({ dev }) => ({
          likes: await axios.get('https://likes.com').then(res => res.data),
        }),
        head: ({ likes, dev }) => [
          ['meta', { name: 'og:likes', content: likes }],
        ];
      };
    
  
```

## Using the Hydrogen config with the Head API

With the global `name` property provided by the [Hydrogen Config](https://hydrogen-js.netlify.app/docs/hydrogen-config), we can use it to manage our page title's

```
    
      const page = () => `
        <p>The head will be injected into the layout</p>
      `;

      module.exports = {
        layout: 'default',
        page,
        head: ({ config }) => [
          ['title', {}, `Head API | ${config.name}`]
        ];
      };
    
  
```

What if you want to update your static assets folder, you can do that to!

```
    
      const page = () => `
        <p>The head will be injected into the layout</p>
      `;

      module.exports = {
        layout: 'default',
        page,
        head: ({ config }) => [
          ['script', { src: `/${config.staticFolder}/js/script.js` }, true]
        ];
      };
    
  
```





# Setting Up a Service Worker | 🎈 Hydrogen

# 💾 Setting Up a Service Worker`+v0.6`

___

A Service Worker is a super powerful browser API that allows you to intercept network requests online or offline. Hydrogen is now able to expose all the generated routes to your Service Worker so that you can do some cool precaching of your routes or whatever fits your use case.

## Basic Setup

Create a simple Service Worker file in the root of your project.

sw.js

```
    
      self.addEventListener('install', (e) => {
        
      });
    
  
```

Register Service Worker in a layout

default.js

```
    
      module.exports = () => `
        <script>
          const registerSW = async () => {
            if (!navigator.serviceWorker) {
              return false;
            }

            const reg = await navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js');

            await reg.update();
          }

          registerSW();
        </script>
      `;
    
  
```

Add the Service Worker file to the config file.

hydrogen.config.js

```
    
      module.exports = {
        sw: 'sw.js',
      };
    
  
```

Run `npx hydrogen build` and the `sw.js` will be copied to the dist folder

## Exposing page routes to your Service Worker

Here is our pages folder structure.

```
    
      /pages
      |_ javascript
        |_ index.js
        |_ functions.js
        |_ oop
          |_ index.js
      |_ java
        |_ index.js
      |_ index.js
    
  
```

Hydrogen generates the above folder structure into an array of routes like the example below.

```
    
      const routes = [
        {
          "route": "/",
          "filename": "index.html",
          "index": true,
          "depth": 0
        },
        {
          "route": "/java",
          "filename": "index.html",
          "index": true,
          "depth": 1 
        },
        {
          "route": "/javascript",
          "filename": "index.html",
          "index": true,
          "depth": 1
        },
        {
          "route": "/javascript",
          "filename": "functions.html"
          "index": false,
          "depth": 1
        },
        {
          "route": "/javascript/oop",
          "filename": "index.html",
          "index": true,
          "depth": 2
        }
      ]
    
  
```

Your `sw.js` now has access to the above `const routes`, so you can do something like creating a simple precache.

You also have access to the `const DEV` which determines the mode

sw.js

```
    
      self.addEventListener('install', (e) => {
        e.waitUntil(caches.open('data').then(cache => {
          return cache.addAll(routes.map(({ route }) => route));
        }));
      });
    
  
```

## Versioning your Service Worker cache`+v0.9`

Managing cache is not the easiest thing in the world, especially if you need to invalidate the cache. You can now get access to the `const CACHE_VERSION` variable which is determined by the version field in your `package.json` file

```
    
      const removeOldCaches = async () => {
        const cacheVersions = await caches.keys();

        const handler = () => Promise.all(cacheVersions.map((cacheName) => caches.delete(cacheName)));

        if (cacheVersions.includes(CACHE_VERSION)) {
          cacheVersions.splice(cacheVersions.indexOf(CACHE_VERSION), 1)
        }

        return handler();
      };

      self.addEventListener('install', (event) => {
        event.waitUntil(removeOldCaches())
      })

      self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
        event.respondWith(
          caches.open(CACHE_VERSION).then((cache) => {
            if (event.request.destination !== 'image') {
              return fetch(event.request);
            }

            return cache.match(event.request).then((cacheResponse) => {
              return cacheResponse || fetch(event.request).then((networkResponse) => {
                cache.put(event.request, networkResponse.clone());
                return networkResponse;
              });
            });
          }),
        );
      });
    
  
```

Here we are deleting our old caches if we deployed a new version of our app, it will only delete the old cache versions if the new cache version was successfully created. If any of the promises fails in `e.waitUntil` then the entire install event will cancel

# ⚙ Generate routes dynamically `+v0.7`

___

What if you want to generate pages dynamically based off some data from an API? Let's say you want to generate blog posts with a unique URL, you can now that!

## Basic setup

Create a file called `hydrogen.routes.js` in the root of your project

hydrogen.routes.js

```
    
      module.exports = async () => [
        {
          path: '/blogs/setting-up-hydrogen',
          data: {
            post: 1,
          },
        },
        {
          path: '/blogs/setting-up-a-service-worker',
          data: {
            post: 2,
          },
        },
      ];
    
  
```

The above function will return an array of routes that can be dynamically generated. We can think of the path like this `/blogs/:dynamic-route` so if you we run `npx hydrogen build` it will generate pages like this:

```
    
      /dist
      |_ /blogs
        |_ /setting-up-hydrogen
          |_ index.html
        |_ /setting-up-a-service-worker
          |_ index.html
    
  
```

Hydrogen will also inject the route information into the Head API, Data API and the Page Template.

## Setting up a dynamic page template

All dynamic page templates are prefixed with an underscore, so a dynamic page will always look this `_index.js`

pages/blogs/\_index.js

```
    
      const page = ({ data }) => `
        <p>${data.content}</p>
      `;

      module.exports = {
        layout: 'default',
        title: 'Hydrogen webpage',
        page,
        data: async ({ route }) => ({
          content: await axios.get('https://api.blog.com/post=${route.data.post}'),
        }),
      };
    
  
```




# Hydrogen Config | 🎈 Hydrogen

> ## Excerpt
> You can pass a config file to the Hydrogen CLI, the config file is accessible to the Layout, Page, Data and Head API

---
# 🔧 Hydrogen Config`+v0.5.6`

You can pass a config file to the Hydrogen CLI, the config file is accessible to the Layout, Page, Data and Head API

Create a file called `hydrogen.config.js` in the root of your project

## Set a global project name

The `name` property can be used as the root title of all your pages

hydrogen.config.js

```
    
      module.exports = {
        name: 'Hydrogen WebApp',
      };
    
  
```

Now we can access the config via the `config` object

layouts/default.js

```
    
      module.exports = ({ config }) => `
        <title>${config.name}</title>
      `;
    
  
```

## Set a static assets folder

We need some way of copying our static assets into the `dist` folder, you can now set a static assets folder via `staticFolder` property.

Your static assets folder must be in the root of the project

hydrogen.config.js

```
    
      module.exports = {
        name: 'Hydrogen Webapp',
        staticFolder: 'public'
      };
    
  
```

## Copy extra static files `+v0.5.11`

You now able to copy static files like `manifest.json` or any root-level files in your project to the `dist` folder

hydrogen.config.js

```
    
      module.exports = {
        name: 'Hydrogen Webapp',
        staticFolder: 'public'
        extraStaticFiles: [
          'robots.txt',
          'manifest.json',
          'sitemap.xml',  
        ]
      };
    
  
```

## Set global head tags

You now have access to the [Head API](https://hydrogen-js.netlify.app/docs/working-with-meta-data) in the config for global meta info

The global head tags are merged with the head tags in each page

```
    
      module.exports = {
        name: 'Hydrogen Webapp',
        staticFolder: 'public',
        head: ({ config }) => [
          ['script', { src: 'https://my.script.js' }, true],
          ['link', { rel: 'stylesheet', href: `/${config.staticFolder}/css/main.css` }],
          ['meta', { property: 'og:site_name', content: config.name }],
        ],
      };
    
  
```

## Setting a custom Service Worker `+v0.6`

Want to add a Service Worker to your application, you can now do that with the `sw` property. Your Service Worker will have access to all the routes generated by Hydrogen. Find out more: [🩺 Setting Up a Service Worker](https://hydrogen-js.netlify.app/docs/setting-up-a-service-worker/)

You still need to manually include the registration script for your Service Worker. You can do that in a layout

```
    
      module.exports = {
        name: 'Hydrogen Webapp',
        sw: 'service_worker.js',
      };
    
  
```

## Delete dist folder before build `+v0.8`

Hydrogen will automatically delete the `dist` folder before each build by default. You can turn this off by setting `build.deleteFolder` to `false`

```
    
      module.exports = {
        build: {
          deleteFolder: false,
        },
      };
    
  
```

# ⛏️ Build hooks`+v1.0`

___

Build hooks allow you to observe events that happen during the Hydrogen build process. You can intercept and modify the context of the build process to your liking.

Here are the events you can observe:

-   `beforeDistRemoved`
-   `afterDistRemoved`
-   `beforeBuild`
-   `afterBuild`
-   `beforeEachPageGenerated`
-   `afterEachPageGenerated`
-   `beforeEachPageSaved`
-   `beforeServiceWorkerGenerated`
-   `afterServiceWorkerGenerated`

## Basic Setup

Create a file called `hydrogen.hooks.js` in the root of your project

All you have to do is export the hooks of the events you want to observe in Hydrogen and that's all there is too it, keep in mind that the `ctx` of the hooks differ.

```
    
      exports.beforeDistRemoved = async (ctx) => {};

      exports.afterDistRemoved = async (ctx) => {};

      exports.beforeBuild = async (ctx) => {};

      exports.afterBuild = async (ctx) => {};

      exports.beforeEachPageGenerated = async (ctx) => {};

      exports.afterEachPageGenerated = async (ctx) => {};

      exports.beforeEachPageSaved = async (ctx) => {};

      exports.beforeServiceWorkerGenerated = async (ctx) => {};

      exports.afterServiceWorkerGenerated = async (ctx) => {};
    
  
```

# 🐛 Debugging Build Process

___

A bi-product of Hydrogen being based on Node.js is that we are able to support debugging of any JavaScript during the Hydrogen build process, just the way you would do with any other Node.js applications.

Let's see how we can do this!

## Using Node.js Devtools in Chrome

Chrome has a built-in tool called the Node.js V8 inspector which allows us to debug Node.js applications in Chrome Devtools

1\. Run the command below in the project root

```
    
      npx --node-arg="--inspect-brk" hydrogen build --dev
    
  
```

2\. You will see output like this

```
    
      Debugger listening on ws://127.0.0.1:9229/f35613dd-25b2-414f-a81f-24be123d59e5
      For help, see: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector
    
  
```

3\. Open the Chrome dev tools and you will see the Node logo popup right next to the Elements tab, click on it and you will go to the Node devtools

![](https://hydrogen-js.netlify.app/public/images/node-dev-tools.png)

4\. Once the Node Devtools are open, you will need to add your project folder to the workspace by clicking on "Add folder to workspace"

![](https://hydrogen-js.netlify.app/public/images/node-inspector.png)

Now you can debug your JavaScript

## Debugging in VS Code

There are two ways we could setup debugging in VS Code, either with VS Code's auto attaching feature or with a `launch.json` file

### Auto attaching

1\. Go to settings and search "auto attach" and turn the setting on

![](https://hydrogen-js.netlify.app/public/images/auto-attach.png)

2\. Set a breakpoint anywhere in your JavaScript

3\. Run the command below

```
    
      npx --node-arg="--inspect-brk" hydrogen build --dev
    
  
```

VS Code will automatically attach to the Node.js debugging process and stop by your breakpoint

### Setting up `launch.json`

1\. Go to the _Debug Explorer_ and click on the _cogwheel_ on the top right, it will open up a `launch.json` file

![](https://hydrogen-js.netlify.app/public/images/vscode-debug.png)

2\. Copy and paste the below JSON config to your launch.json file

```
    
      {
        "version": "0.2.0",
        "configurations": [
          {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Debug Hydrogen CLI",
            "skipFiles": [
              "<node_internals>/**"
            ],
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/hydrogen-cli/bin/run",
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
            "args": ["build", "--dev"],
          }
        ]
      }
    
  
```

Make sure to set a breakpoint

3\. Go back to the Debug Explorer and run the debug "Debug Hydrogen CLI"
